# Day 3

Consider a simplified DM model, with a scalar s-channel mediator and DM
candidate among those in `DMsimp_s_spin0`.  
Identify a signature of your interest.  
Calculate the signal cross section at LO.  
Identify the main SM irreducible backgrounds.  
Try to design a simple analysis to select the signal over the backgrounds using
`MA5`.

## Results

To obtain the following results, `cd` in the current directory and run:

```bash
mg5_aMC ex3.mg5
```
